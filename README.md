## Quick Start

[Grab the latest release here.](https://github.com/platberlitz/SillyBunny/releases/latest)

Or run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/platberlitz/SillyBunny.git
cd SillyBunny
```

Then, run the appropriate launcher for your OS, which auto-installs all dependencies, checks for updates, and starts a server instance. You can also open `http://127.0.0.1:4444` manually in your browser.

| Platform | Command |
|----------|---------|
| Windows | `.\Start.bat` |
| macOS (Terminal) | `./Start.command` |
| macOS (Finder) | Double-click `Start.command` (right-click > Open if Gatekeeper warns) |
| Linux / WSL | `./start.sh` |
| Docker | `docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up --build`
| Android (Termux) | `bash start.sh` |

If you already manage your own Bun install, run via `bun run start`. Other launch variants:

```bash
bun run start:mobile   # lower-memory (--smol)
bun run start:global   # SillyBunny-owned data paths
bun run start:no-csrf  # disable CSRF (local dev)
```

### macOS notes

- If the launcher window closes too fast, run `./Start.command` from Terminal to keep output visible
- If Git is missing, the launcher triggers `xcode-select --install` automatically
- Quarantine metadata from ZIP downloads: `xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /path/to/SillyBunny`
- Stripped permissions from unzip: `chmod +x Start.command start.sh scripts/*.sh`

### Termux (Android) notes

```bash
pkg update && pkg upgrade -y
pkg install -y git curl unzip
git clone https://github.com/platberlitz/SillyBunny.git
cd SillyBunny
bash start.sh
```

- The launcher defaults to Node.js + npm on native Termux (more reliable than Bun under grun)
- To force Bun anyway: `SILLYBUNNY_TERMUX_RUNTIME=bun bash start.sh`
- For shared storage access: `termux-setup-storage` once before starting

---

### How to Update

| What you want | Command |
|---------------|---------|
| Normal launch (auto-checks for updates) | `./start.sh` |
| Force update then launch | `./start.sh --self-update` |
| Update only, don't start | `./start.sh --self-update-only` |
| Skip update check once | `./start.sh --skip-self-update` |
| Disable auto-update permanently | `SILLYBUNNY_AUTO_UPDATE=0 ./start.sh` |

## Changes vs. SillyTavern

### Different UI

The original SillyTavern layout is replaced with a custom, easy-to-navigate graphical shell:

- **Top bar**: Reworked with cleaner, better-defined nested menus. Includes Navigate, Customize, Home, and Characters.
- **Bottom bar**: New bottom bar designed for quick access to persona switching, quick chat switching, and add/edit/remove existing chat functionality.
- **Panel-oriented navigation**: Easy access to all settings in nested panels. Collapsible settings sections in both Chat Completions and Text Completions presets.
- **Global search**: A global search bar that queries across presets, lore, extensions, personas, and settings at once.
- **Platform-aware**: Designed for both desktop and mobile, with a dedicated phone/tablet navigation layer
- **Three modern shell themes**: Modern Glass, Clean Minimal, Bold Stylized
- **Palette customization**: Easily change the accent colour of any theme you're currently using.

### Bun-first runtime

Instead of node.js, this fork uses Bun. This results in consistently faster startups, overall performance, and automatic launcher bootstraping. Node.js is still fully functional as a fallback system.

### In-Chat Agnetic Support

SillyBunny has support for In-Chat Agents. These are custom prompt fields that can run separately from the main generation, which allows for a lot of extra flexibility. Included are several pre-built prompts designed for trackers, post-gen cleanup, anti-slop, and more. Agents can use the main model or a different connection profile, allowing for a fast, smaller model to run long agnetic tasks with ease while a large, main model writes the actual story content.

This feature is currently in beta. These are designed to fill the gap between full extensions and simple, modular agnetic functionality.

**Pipeline:**

1. **Pre-generation agents** injects prompt text before the main reply is generated.
2. **Main Model** writes the main RP reply.
3. **Post-generation agents** optionally rewrites the contents of the main response, or appends extra content after the reply.
4. **Post-process utilities** can extract structured data, run regex cleanup/formatting, or preserve machine-readable blocks while showing cleaner UI.
5. **Groups and templates** let you swap whole stacks quickly without editing your base preset every time.

**Typical Usecases:**

- Trackers for scene, time, items, relationships, off-screen activity, and world state.
- Writing cleanup passes like anti-slop or regex-based formatting.
- Formatting helpers like direction menus, CYOA choices, or NPC profile cards.
- Randomisers and directives that change the pressure, genre, pacing, or escalation of a scene.
- Content toggles for prose style, difficulty, POV, and HTML artifacts.
- Agentic lorebook navigation for on-demand retrieval, memory maintenance, and tree building.
- Cheap helper-model passes that prepare or polish content without spending your main model's budget.

**Included Agents**

* **Trackers:** Achievements, CYOA Choices, Direction Menu, Event, Item, NPC Profiles, Parallel Off-Screen, Relationship, Reputation, Scene, Secrets, Status, Time, and World Detail.
* **Randomizers:** Chaos Mode, Combined Director's Cut, Dead Dove Escalation, Genre, Grounded Complication, Intimacy & Kink, Scene Driving Force, and Scene Pressure Cocktail.
* **Content:** Difficulty Increase, Don't Write for User, Friction Mode, Grounded Prose, HTML Toggle, and Write for User.
* **Post Generation Editors:** Prose Polisher
* **Additional Agents:** Pathfinder (an agentic lorebook navigator with 8 tools for retrieval, memory maintenance, and tree building).

**Agent Behaviors and Settings**
* Agentic prompts feature inline run-order editing, click-to-edit functionality, and fullscreen prompt editors.
* Agents use the main connection profile by default with an 8192 max token limit. Separate connection profile support is available when explicitly selected.
* Bundled trackers, including CYOA Choices, are configured for pre-generation. The main model emits clickable options directly in the response.
* All bundled tracker and menu agents default to the User injection role to maintain compatibility with models that deprioritize System injections.
* Built-in groups are available for the full preset, trackers only, and randomizers only.
* Custom agents support ST-style regex options.

### Bundled Goodies & Tutorials
SillyBunny includes some extras by default to help you get started right away:
* A tutorial that guides you through the SillyBunny interface.
* Pre-bundled roleplay presets from purachina and Geechan.
* A character card conversion preset from TLD to help you generate character cards from scratch, or convert from existing cards to a better format.
* A friendly quick-start guide with optional recommended extensions (Summary Sharder, Dialogue Colours, Quick Image Gen, Guided Generations, CSS Snippets).
* Two custom assistants to help you get started - Bunny Guide, and Assistant Nahida.

## Latest Update

### v1.4.0 (2026-04-21)

**User Experience**

- Replaced the old per-shell settings search bars with a single universal search row under the SillyBunny logo, so search is always available no matter which panel is open
- Universal search now expands downward from the top bar, searches across both Workspace and Customize, and jumps directly to matching settings on desktop and mobile
- Moved Open Launchpad button next to Temporary Chat for better visual alignment
- Open Launchpad button now toggles the launchpad (opens if closed, closes if open)
- Added active state highlighting to Open Launchpad button when launchpad is open
- Launchpad now expands by default on first startup to showcase tutorials
- Home now highlights in the top bar while the landing page is visible, matching the active-state treatment used by the shell buttons
- Switching from Navigate to Customize no longer double-triggers and closes the shell again during the opening animation
- Home now reflows from its own panel width, so returning from Customize no longer crushes the landing copy into a narrow one-word column

**Themes and Appearance**

- Changed default UI theme to Dark V1.0 (from Default (Dark) 1.7.1)
- Changed default shell style to Clean Minimal (from Modern Glass)
- Removed Forest Dusk, Forest Dawn, and Rose Glow theme preset buttons
- Added 9 accent color preset buttons (blue, cyan, green, yellow, orange, red, pink, purple, gray) for quick color adjustments
- Added Custom RGB Accent toggle with color pickers for full accent customization
- Reset button now resets theme colors to Dark V1.0
- Fixed extension containers showing brown colors by updating default CSS variables to match Dark V1.0
- Removed hardcoded brown colors from Modern Glass and Bold Stylized shell themes
- Made shell themes fully theme-aware - they now adapt to your chosen theme colors instead of forcing brown tones
- Replaced icon-only panel mode toggles with labeled buttons (Full Home, Compact, List only)
- Removed the remaining hardcoded brown accents from the home shell, popups, extension panels, and shared UI fallbacks so theme colors stay consistent after refreshes
- Quick context shortcut buttons now render in a strict horizontal row for both Text Completions and Chat Completions
- Accent color preset swatches are now visible on mobile and use smaller touch-friendly circles that fit narrow screens better
- Recent Chats now clips cleanly with corrected corner rounding

**Bug fixes**

- Fixed extensions disappearing from UI after updates — stale entries in the disabled-extensions list are now automatically cleaned on reload
- Fixed Advanced Definitions modal appearing behind Characters drawer on mobile by increasing z-index
- Fixed reasoning token counts not displaying separately — now shows format like `150t (45r)` where 45r is reasoning tokens
- Fixed auto-cache refresh causing initialization loop on fresh instances by skipping cache clear when no prior settings exist
- Fixed auto-cache refresh not fully clearing cached assets by using hard reload instead of soft reload
- Reduced Import Folder and Sync Extensions button sizes on mobile for better fit
- Removed bloated search hint text and tab descriptions on mobile for cleaner UI
- Added reinstall button for third-party extensions to quickly fix corrupted extensions by deleting and reinstalling from repository
- Changed fresh-install API defaults so Chat Completions is the first/main default instead of the old Text Completion or Horde/Kobold path

**Reasoning and provider compatibility**

- Simplified reasoning controls by removing the separate "Show thought in chat" toggle, so "Request model reasoning" is the single control again
- Fixed response text extraction for OpenAI-style and Gemini-style payloads so parts/content/candidates/tool-plan formats render correctly instead of collapsing into blank or broken output
- Fixed Gemini thought-signature handling by reading `candidates[].content.parts` correctly and checking the `gemini.thoughtSignatures` config dynamically
- Added clarification tooltip for "Request model reasoning" toggle explaining behavior for Custom OpenAI-compatible providers

**Agents and message tools**

- Fixed message metadata badges so reasoning-token counts and agent-change actions stay in sync during both initial render and later message updates
- Upgraded in-chat agent transform history to show semantic diffs with insert/delete highlighting while keeping Undo/Redo actions
- Updated agent transform diff styling to match recast-post-processing — more subtle colors with rgba transparency for cleaner visual appearance
- Added a dedicated "View agent changes" message action and wired it to the same transform-history popup as the inline badge
- Hardened agent error/result serialization for non-JSON values and updated adventure-helper status copy to be clearer in the UI
- Normalized structured agent/prompt content before text-completion fallback and post-generation passes, so XML-style prompts and appended assistant responses no longer degrade into `[object Object]`

**Bottom bar and persona fixes**

- Fixed bottom-bar chat switching to use the shared chat-opening flow and added retry refresh logic so chat lists populate more reliably after startup and chat events
- Fixed bottom-bar persona switching by preferring `/persona-set` with safely quoted avatar ids and improving active persona detection
- Fixed persona switching when multiple personas share the same name — the bottom bar now correctly selects by avatar ID instead of always falling back to the first name match
- Fixed bottom bar not loading on first page load in Node.js environments — added APP_READY state check and increased retry attempts from 8 to 30

**UI polish**

- Established comprehensive spacing design system using CSS custom properties for consistent spacing, button sizing, and component padding across desktop and mobile
- Fixed button sizing asymmetry — all send form buttons now use consistent sizes (42px desktop, 40px tablet, 38px mobile)
- Corrected asymmetric padding throughout cards, panels, inputs, and navigation elements for visual balance
- Standardized popup control gaps and welcome panel spacing for consistency
- Fixed checkbox and text label alignment across all UI components on both desktop and mobile
- Improved mobile navigation padding symmetry and textarea input consistency
- Enhanced WebKit browser compatibility while maintaining all existing Safari-specific fixes
- Added persistent Full Home, Compact, and List only display modes for the Home welcome panel so recent chats can stay visible without the large onboarding card taking over the chat area
- Tightened the World Info workspace layout so the entry list and editor pane fit better on desktop-sized windows
- Improved checkbox alignment, mobile/editor layout behavior, and escaped macro braces in the in-chat agent prompt placeholder so template tokens display literally
- Added branch switching dropdown to Server Admin panel — switch between main and staging with confirmation dialog, auto-stash option, and automatic restart
- Added context size options at 4k increments — 12k, 20k, 24k, 28k, and 36k-60k now available to fill gaps between existing sizes
