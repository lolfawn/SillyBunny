# SillyBunny

Based on **SillyTavern 1.17.0 stable** -- same data, same extensions, better shell.

SillyBunny is a fork of [SillyTavern](https://github.com/SillyTavern/SillyTavern) that keeps the workflow you already know but ships it inside a cleaner UI, a Bun-first backend, and two lightweight agent systems for roleplay.

Project site, presets, themes, and extras: [platberlitz.github.io](https://platberlitz.github.io/)

> [!WARNING]
> Active fork. UI, Bun compat, and upstream syncs are ongoing, so expect some churn.

## At a glance

| | |
|-|-|
| **Runtime** | Bun (auto-installed), Node.js fallback |
| **Default port** | `4444` |
| **UI** | Custom navigation shell with search, themes, and mobile layout |
| **Agents** | Built-in Agent Mode + user-facing In-Chat Agents for modular RP prompting |
| **Data** | Drop-in compatible with SillyTavern characters, chats, presets, and extensions |

---

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/platberlitz/SillyBunny.git
cd SillyBunny
```

Then run the launcher for your OS:

| Platform | Command |
|----------|---------|
| Linux / WSL | `./start.sh` |
| macOS (Terminal) | `./Start.command` |
| macOS (Finder) | Double-click `Start.command` (right-click > Open if Gatekeeper warns) |
| Windows | `.\Start.bat` |
| Android (Termux) | `bash start.sh` |

The launcher handles everything: installs Bun if missing, installs packages, checks for updates, then starts the server. Open `http://127.0.0.1:4444` in your browser.

If you already manage your own Bun install, `bun run start` still works. Other launch variants:

```bash
bun run start:mobile   # lower-memory (--smol)
bun run start:global   # SillyBunny-owned data paths
bun run start:no-csrf  # disable CSRF (local dev)
```

### macOS notes

- If the launcher window closes too fast, run `./Start.command` from Terminal to keep output visible
- If Git is missing, the launcher triggers `xcode-select --install` automatically
- Quarantine metadata from ZIP downloads: `xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /path/to/SillyBunny`
- Stripped permissions from unzip: `chmod +x Start.command start.sh scripts/*.sh`

### Termux (Android) notes

```bash
pkg update && pkg upgrade -y
pkg install -y git curl unzip
git clone https://github.com/platberlitz/SillyBunny.git
cd SillyBunny
bash start.sh
```

- The launcher defaults to Node.js + npm on native Termux (more reliable than Bun under grun)
- To force Bun anyway: `SILLYBUNNY_TERMUX_RUNTIME=bun bash start.sh`
- For shared storage access: `termux-setup-storage` once before starting

### Update controls

| What you want | Command |
|---------------|---------|
| Normal launch (auto-checks for updates) | `./start.sh` |
| Force update then launch | `./start.sh --self-update` |
| Update only, don't start | `./start.sh --self-update-only` |
| Skip update check once | `./start.sh --skip-self-update` |
| Disable auto-update permanently | `SILLYBUNNY_AUTO_UPDATE=0 ./start.sh` |

## What's different from SillyTavern

### Better UI

The stock SillyTavern layout is replaced with a custom navigation shell:

- **Left/right panel navigation** for workspace and customization
- **Search-first** across presets, lore, extensions, personas, and settings
- **Mobile-aware** with a dedicated phone/tablet navigation layer
- **Collapsible settings sections** in both Chat Completions and Text Completions presets
- **Three shell themes**: Modern Glass, Clean Minimal, Bold Stylized
- **Three palette presets**: Forest Dusk, Forest Dawn, Rose Glow
- **Three message styles**: Flat, Bubbles, Document

### Bun-first runtime

Bun is the default. Startup is faster, and the launchers bootstrap it automatically. Node.js still works as a fallback.

### Agents, without the buzzword soup

SillyBunny has **two different agent systems**, and they solve different problems:

- **Agent Mode** is the built-in service layer. It handles retrieval, memory, and lorebook upkeep for an active chat.
- **In-Chat Agents** are user-facing prompt modules. They are the modular building blocks you toggle on the Agents page for trackers, formatting, cleanup, randomisers, and other RP helpers.

These are not autonomous "go do tasks on the internet" agents. They are deliberately scoped prompt hooks around the chat generation pipeline.

### How agents work

The short version:

1. **Pre-generation agents** can inject prompt text before the main reply is generated.
2. **The main model** writes the assistant response as usual.
3. **Post-generation prompt transforms** can optionally rewrite the reply or append extra content after the reply. These can use the main model or a different connection profile.
4. **Post-process utilities** can extract structured data, run regex cleanup/formatting, or preserve machine-readable blocks while showing cleaner UI.
5. **Groups and templates** let you swap whole stacks quickly without editing your base preset every time.

Typical uses:

- Trackers for scene, time, items, relationships, off-screen activity, and world state
- Formatting helpers like direction menus, CYOA choices, or NPC profile cards
- Cleanup passes like anti-slop or regex-based formatting
- Randomisers and directives that change the pressure, genre, pacing, or escalation of a scene
- Cheap helper-model passes that prepare or polish content without spending your main model's budget

### Agent Mode

Agent Mode is the built-in chat-scoped system for durable story support.

**Current services:**

- **Retrieval** -- injects relevant context from recent chat, memory, and lorebooks before the next reply
- **Memory** -- updates compact long-term memory after a reply is saved
- **Lorebook** -- syncs lorebook entries after a reply is saved

**How it works:**

- Each service can reuse the main chat profile or use its own source/model/reverse-proxy settings
- You can copy the active chat profile to all Agent Mode services in one click
- Agent Mode state is stored per chat
- World info entries can be marked `Agent blacklisted` to exclude them from agent processing

**Scope:**

- Runs with active chats only
- Targets the chat-completions pipeline
- Intentionally lightweight: the goal is stronger RP support, not autonomous orchestration

### In-Chat Agents (Beta)

In-Chat Agents are modular prompt blocks you can create, toggle, group, refine, import, export, and share.

Think of them like a mini prompt pipeline builder inside the Agents page:

- Each agent has a **phase**: `Pre`, `Post`, or `Pre/Post`
- Each agent has a **run order**, so you can decide what runs first or later within a pass
- Agents can be gated by **generation type**, **keywords**, or **trigger probability**
- Agents can target the **main connection** or a separate **connection profile**
- Agents can carry **regex scripts** in a SillyTavern-style format for output formatting and cleanup
- Agents can run **prompt transforms** in `rewrite` or `append` mode
- Agents can be bundled into **Agent Groups** for one-click setup

**What ships with v1.3.2:**

- **31 bundled templates** based on Pura's Director Preset ecosystem
- Trackers, randomisers, directives, formatting helpers, anti-slop, and content toggles
- Built-in groups for the full preset, trackers only, and randomisers only
- ST-style regex options for bundled and custom agents
- Per-agent and global prompt-transform toast notifications
- Inline run-order editing directly from the agent cards
- Prompt-transform greeting protection: greeting messages are intentionally left alone

**Bundled defaults in v1.3.2:**

- Bundled trackers are set up for **post-generation prompt append**
- Bundled regex-backed helpers default to **post-generation**
- `Anti-Slop Regex` remains the exception and stays a straightforward cleanup tool
- Pura's Director Preset now ships in **two versions**:
  - **SillyTavern** version: includes the Toggle and Randomiser prompts
  - **SillyBunny** version: keeps the Main, Primary Toggles, and Prefill Toggles, because Agents cover the optional toggles and randomisers

**Status:** Beta. The goal is fast, toggleable prompt modules for RP without needing to write a full extension.

## Changelog

### v1.3.2 (2026-04-13)

**UI/UX overhaul**

- Redesigned shell panels: centered on screen, narrower (900px max), horizontal tab bar at top instead of vertical sidebar
- Centered shell animations: all shells now open with a scale+fade from center, replacing the directional slide-in
- Rearranged top bar: Navigate + Customize on the left, Home + Characters on the right, removed duplicate API button
- Added customizable quick-access shortcut buttons in the top bar (configurable in Settings)
- Removed the optional chatbar overlay; integrated chat management (select, new, rename, delete) into the bottom bar
- Added persona quick-access bubble next to the chat input with popup picker
- Added bottom bar size slider (replaces the desktop top bar size slider)
- Home screen defaults to First Steps tab with launchpad collapsed; renamed "Replay Tutorial" to "Show Launchpad"
- Added "Chat with Assistant Nahida" button on the home screen alongside "Open Assistant"
- Assistant Nahida is now created at app startup so she appears in the character list by default
- Starter pack split into "Pre-installed" and "Optional installs" sections with clearer wording
- Added Summary Sharder and Guided Generations (forked) to the optional installs in the starter pack
- Bundled Memory Sharding Quick Reply preset for chat summarisation

**Agent mode changes**

- Removed Agent Mode orchestration (retrieval/memory/lorebook services) to match the "intentionally lightweight" philosophy
- Kept In-Chat Agents as a standalone tab with its own settings panel
- Recommended Summary Sharder extension as the memory solution in the starter pack

**Bug fixes**

- Fixed stop generation button: `onStopStreaming()` now properly sets `isStopped` flag to prevent generation from appearing to complete normally
- Fixed story branching performance: replaced deep `structuredClone` of entire chat with shallow copy, only deep-cloning the target message when swipe selection requires it
- Fixed `applyBundledOptInDefaults()` always returning true (`return true || changed` → `return changed`)
- Fixed CLIENT_VERSION format: removed `v` prefix so `versionCompare()` works correctly with extensions that specify `minimum_client_version`
- Fixed circular dependency TDZ errors in GuidedGenerations, TunnelVision, Quick Reply, and TTS extensions
- Fixed duplicate TTS settings panel by adding init guard
- Fixed shell search results showing generic "Extensions" label instead of actual extension/section names
- Added single-dropdown-at-a-time enforcement via `closeAllDropdowns()`

**Platform support**

- Added Node.js fallback launcher: `start-node.sh`, `Start-Node.bat`, `npm run start:node`
- Auto-detect macOS and ARM platforms and switch to Node.js to avoid Bun CPU overhead (oven-sh/bun#26415)
- `SILLYBUNNY_USE_NODE=1` environment variable forces Node.js on any platform

### v1.3.1 (2026-04-12)

**In-Chat Agents**

- Fixed the broken agent-card interactions and restored reliable backend-backed Agent Group behavior
- Added ST-style regex script support for agents, including bundled regex packs for tracker and formatting templates
- Added prompt-transform passes with `rewrite` and `append` modes, optional alternate connection profiles, and automatic message refresh after mutation
- Bundled trackers now default to post-generation prompt append, while bundled regex-backed helpers default to post-generation behavior
- Greeting messages are now left untouched by all prompt-transform agents
- Added global and per-agent toast notifications for prompt-transform runs, enabled by default
- Added inline run-order editing on agent cards with clearer `lower first` ordering semantics
- Removed the duplicate bundled `Director Core` case and added bundled-template migration helpers for saved agents
- Split Pura's Director Preset into **SillyBunny** and **SillyTavern** variants

**Starter pack and bundled extras**

- Starter-pack extension cards now install **Character Colors** and **Image Gen** directly from GitHub instead of shipping their files inside the repo
- Updated the preset starter card to explain the two Director Preset variants more clearly

**UI/UX fixes**

- Moved the Agent Mode status overview inside the Agent Mode drawer so the Agents page reads more cleanly

## Compatibility

SillyBunny is a fork, not a replacement. Most SillyTavern behavior, data formats, and ecosystem knowledge still apply.
