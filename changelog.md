# Changelog

## v1.4.1

Date: 2026-04-23

Changes:
- Fixed the World Info entry enable/disable regression by restoring the kill-switch event binding to the current button markup.
- Reworked the World Info entry header layout so controls stack more cleanly on narrower desktop widths and mobile screens.
- Added bulk delete actions for saved presets in the OpenAI and Text Completion preset pickers.
- Added a bulk delete action for saved connection profiles in Connection Manager.
- Clarified Pathfinder diagnostics so the UI explains that Tool Agents are only required for Pathfinder tool mode, not for pipeline lorebook retrieval.
- Added compact home shortcut buttons for Sample Characters, Import Character, Open API, and Extensions.
- Aligned the reasoning token badge more evenly with the standard token counter.
- Based bottom-bar sizing on the top-bar size variable so the shell chrome stays visually consistent across desktop and mobile.
- Preserved transparency for cropped avatar images and alpha-capable thumbnails instead of flattening them to opaque backgrounds.
- Bumped the app version strings and default-user settings version to `1.4.1`.
